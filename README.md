## What's this?
This is a performance-oriented, configurable Toolhead platform for the Monolith Gantry which was made for the Voron V2.4/Trident by CloakedWayne.
Everything on this Toolhead is made to work smoothly inside the Monolith Gantry, which results into 0 Build Volume loss and to actually use it´s full potential.

## 2024 Roadmap
### Planned improvements for R1:
- Fully Metall Version to Support Chube and Secret Hotend Conduction, as well as some improved Water Options.
- VZHextruder Configuration since those stupid mounting positions are annoying.

## Design goals
- It was made to fit inside the Monolith Gantry wihtout loosing anything
- To get rid of the Toolhead limitation which results into ringing and or unwanted stuff
- Lightweight

## Performance expectations
- Since it is a lightweight Toolhead, expect extrem high IS results and faster Speed in general
- Your only downside should be the choice of extruder in long term running.
- Don´t use this Toolhead if you consider CAN Support. Some Extruders will probably allow it, but i don´t have them in mind. 

## Printed parts guide
- Recommended print settings: 4 walls, 42% infill (or more), 0.2mm layer height, 0.4mm nozzle
- Recommended print settings for carrier: 3 walls, 100% infill, 0.15-02mm layer height, 0.4 nozzle
- Recommended material: **ABS CF/GF or better**

## Bills of Material
- 2x MakerBeam XL T-Nut 15x15 (Not realy needed, but way more comfortable)
